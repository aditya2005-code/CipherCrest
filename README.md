# CipherCrest - Decentralized Netbanking Platform.
--INTRODUCTION--
CipherCrest is a next-generation netbanking system powered by a blockchain-based decentralized ledger. This platform reimagines digital banking by replacing traditional centralized databases with a secure, transparent, and immutable distributed ledger.
The e-banking sector has transformed banking services through offering customers uninterrupted, on-demand access to banking features. Traditional net banking platforms, however, are highly centralized and thus vulnerable to information breaches, system failures, and non-transparency.
This project proposes the development of a decentralized net banking website utilizing blockchain technology to improve data security, transparency, and control over financial transactions. Blockchainâ€™s immutability and distributed ledger features ensure a tamper-proof transaction record, reducing fraud and operational risks.
The system will have smart contracts for automatic recurring transactions and will keep sensitive user and transaction information in a decentralized form to ensure privacy as well as resilience.

--PROJECT OBJECTIVE--
The goal of this project is to build a net banking website that is more secure, transparent, and trustworthy by using blockchain technology.
Instead of saving user and transaction data in one central place (like in traditional banks), this system will use blockchain to store the data across many systems. This makes it harder to hack or lose data.

What we want to achieve:
*A simple website where users can log in and use banking services.*
*Safe money transfers using blockchain.*
*Automatic handling of repeated transactions using smart contracts.*
*A permanent record of all transactions that cannot be changed.*
*Protection of user data using advanced security methods.*

How this helps users:
*Keeps their personal and banking data safe.*
*Makes all transactions clear and easy to track.*
*Reduces fraud and errors in money transfers.*    
*Allows them to access banking features anytime, anywhere.*
